Upon logging in and selecting your workspace, follow the instructions below


Enter the following command in VS Project for Azure to be able to see your project and install a playwright.service.config.js file which will be used to run the project in the cloud:
npm init @azure/microsoft-playwright-testing
Install Azure CLI with Homebrew on a command prompt
Log into Azure through the command prompt:
az login (It'll open a microsoft login window which you should authenticate with. Upon logging in, the CLI will log you in)
